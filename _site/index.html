        <p><strong>Submission for 2022 NLMUSD Hackathon</strong></p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Diego Contreras from John Glenn High School. I have been programming since I was in middle school, completely self-taught, and have a great deal in experience working with computers. This year’s theme is to <strong>teach something we are passionate about</strong>. Personally, I am passionate about <strong>hacking</strong>. Because of how vast the field is, I’ll teach you one small attack: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARP-Spoofed DoS</code>. This specific attack allows you to completely block a device on a network from accessing the internet for as long as you’d like.</p>

<h2 id="notice">Notice</h2>
<p><strong><em>The following should not be tried on a system you do not own or have permission to mess with. In addition, this hack will not work with all routers and devices; Both can possibly have protections against this, making it useless.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Before getting to the exciting stuff, you’ll need the following to perform the attack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a Linux-based OS (Debian, Fedora, Arch, Ubuntu, Kali, ect.)</li>
  <li>Have <em>consented</em> access to a cheap home router (expensive ones may have protections against this attack)</li>
  <li>Know the basics of packets and protocols.</li>
  <li>Know the basics of the command line.</li>
  <li>Have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmap</code> installed via your package manager (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install nmap</code> for Debian-based OS)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/teach.png" alt="example" /></p>

<p>Normally, your computer sends all of its data to the router, as pictured above. However, using a technique known as ARP Poisoning, you can trick your computer into sending all its data to a hacker’s computer. After this, the hacker can do whatever they want with it. The picture above shows it simply passing it along to the router, giving you internet access while the hacker can see everything you are doing.</p>

<p>For the sake of this tutorial, we will only be worrying about the first part: ARP Poisoning. We will NOT do anything with the packets and simply drop them, resulting in the target computer not having internet access.</p>

<h2 id="performing-the-attack">Performing the attack</h2>
<p>To perform this attack, we will be using <a href="https://github.com/libnet/nemesis">nemesis</a>. This tool is used for many things relating to packet creation and formation, but today we will use it to create and spoof ARP packets.</p>

<h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3>
<p>Install <a href="https://github.com/libnet/nemesis">nemesis</a> by following the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/libnet/nemesis/blob/master/README.md">README</a> or getting it from its <a href="https://github.com/libnet/nemesis/releases/tag/v1.8">releases</a>.</p>

<p>After this, get the private IP addresses of every device on your network via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.1/24</code>. The output will look something like the following:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>user@hackerman ~&gt; sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.1/24

<p>This simply lists the MAC Addresses and IP Addresses of every device on the network, with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.1</code> being the IP address of your router. Choose a device and write down its IP and MAC Address. For the sake of this tutorial, I’ll use the Nintendo Switch connected with an IP address of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.113</code>. Write this down in addition to the IP of the router mentioned before.</p>

<h3 id="step-2">Step 2</h3>
<p>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>user@hackerman ~&gt; ifconfig

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command simply lists the network cards attached to your computer. Write down the MAC address of your computer; In this case it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">60:14:B3:B9:DE:BD</code> for the MAC Address. In addition, write down the name of the network card. In this case it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wlp6s0</code>.</p>

<p>By now, you should have the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nintendo Switch
    <ul>
      <li>IP : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.113</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>My Computer
    <ul>
      <li>MAC: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">60:14:B3:B9:DE:BD</code></li>
      <li>Network Card: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wlp6s0</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Router
    <ul>
      <li>IP: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.1</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>
<p>NOTE: This is the step that might not work with all routers. Some may have protections against it, and at most you’ll only block access to the router’s login page and nothing more.</p>

<p>Here we will run the actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nemesis</code> command:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>user@hackerman ~&gt; sudo nemesis arp -c 10000 -i 1 -v -r -d wlp6s0 -S 192.168.1.1 -D 192.168.1.113 -h $60:14:B3:B9:DE:BD

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Essentially, this command crafts an ARP packet that fools the Nintendo Switch into thinking the attacking computer is the router. As the attacking computer won’t send that packet to the internet, the device no longer has access to the internet. Because the device re-asks the network “Hey, are you <em>sure</em> this is the router?” every few seconds, the command keeps sending packets every second to make sure the device has no internet.</p>

<p>If we instead attacked another linux computer, we can run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arp</code> command on the victim device <strong>before</strong> and <strong>after</strong> to show how the MAC address changed to that of the attacking computer, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.189</code> is the IP of the attacking computer:</p>

<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>user@hackerman ~&gt; arp 
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
192.168.1.1              ether   F4:69:42:EC:F6:A8   C                     wlp6s0
192.168.1.189            ether   60:14:B3:B9:DE:BD   C                     wlp6s0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>user@hackerman ~&gt; arp 
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
192.168.1.1              ether   60:14:B3:B9:DE:BD   C                     wlp6s0
192.168.1.189            ether   60:14:B3:B9:DE:BD   C                     wlp6s0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the MAC value of the router is the same as the attacking computer after this command, meaning that sending anything to the router is essentially the same as sending it to the attacker, who will do nothing with it thus resulting in no internet.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>By applying basic knowledge of networking and using a simple tool, it is possible to prevent someone to use to internet. While the applications of this specific attack is underwhelming, the reconnaissance and tools used have several other applications other than this in several other attacks. One such attack is part of a major technique in hacking: Man in the Middle Attacks (MITM). These types of attack use almost the same technique (ARP Poisoning) with a few modifications to listen into conversations between devices, giving you the full picture of what is going on between two devices. In conclusion, with the knowledge you have gained, I hope you are ready to take on bigger, better hacks that don’t end you up in jail.</p>
