# NLM-Hackathon22

This is my entry for NLMUSD's 2022 Hackathon. Website was generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Hacker Theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker). Sources for the actual hack itself were sourced from the one and only [Hacking The Art of Exploitation 2nd Edition](https://repo.zenk-security.com/Magazine%20E-book/Hacking-%20The%20Art%20of%20Exploitation%20(2nd%20ed.%202008)%20-%20Erickson.pdf)
